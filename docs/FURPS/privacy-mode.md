# Privacy Mode FURPS ([#17619](https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/issues/17619))

## Functionality
- Implement a **Privacy Mode toggle** to disable all third-party integrations globally.
- Allow users to activate Privacy Mode during onboarding or from app settings at any time.
- Ensure deactivation of all identified services:
  - Ethereum RPC providers
  - Swap providers
  - WalletConnect
  - On/off ramps
  - Gif search
  - News Feed (if it still uses RSS)
  - Any fallback RPCs or trackers
- Optional: disable connection to Waku Store nodes if a way for users to configure one themselves is availble
- Optional: Enable users to setup their own RPC provider
- Prevent network traffic to third-party endpoints when Privacy Mode is enabled.

## Usability
- Display clear information about what Privacy Mode disables and why.
- Integrate the toggle seamlessly in both onboarding and settings UI.
- Show contextual UI messages when features are unavailable due to Privacy Mode.
- Avoid overwhelming users with technical details; keep the interaction simple and confidence-boosting.

## Reliability
- Guarantee strict enforcement: no third-party calls occur when Privacy Mode is on.
- Ensure that Privacy Mode settings persist across sessions and updates.
- Avoid state leakage or edge cases where a previously enabled service might resume.
- Cover edge cases (e.g., user switching networks or profiles while Privacy Mode is on).

## Performance
- Reduce overhead by not initializing or pinging unnecessary third-party services.
- Ensure smooth transition when toggling Privacy Mode on/off without app restarts.

## Supportability
- Centralize Privacy Mode configuration in a single flag or module.
- Provide developer hooks or feature flags to test and enforce privacy constraints.
- Document all third-party dependencies and their relation to Privacy Mode.
- Add automated tests and runtime checks to prevent future regressions or silent violations.
