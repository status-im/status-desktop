## Build instructions:
1. Open a shell terminal inside the cloned repo
2. mkdir build && cd build
3. cmake ..
4. make

## Install Instructions
Once you built the package just type
```
make install
```
by default cmake will install to the default CMAKE prefix.
If you want to customize this location type the following command
during the build steps when invoking cmake
```
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=/path/to/install/prefix path/to/CMakeLists.txt
```
