# Internationalization

App is translated to many different languages through lokalise.com platform.

## TLDR

### Update base translations file
1. Update qml_en.ts file: `cd scripts/translationScripts && python update-en-ts.py`
2. Ensure updated qml_en.ts file lands on master

### Update translations
1. Create pull request with exported translations using lokalise.com, see [docs](https://docs.lokalise.com/en/articles/1684090-github)

## Lokalise workflow

Lokalise is a continuous localization and translation management platform. It integrates into development workflow and automates localization process.

Lokalise workflow:
1. Upload english strings (qml_en.ts) to Lokalise project. This is done automatically, Lokalise auto-pull changes done to master's qml_en.ts file
2. Translate strings to target languages. Target languages are driven by Lokalise configuration. Translations are done by community
3. Export *.ts files with translations (e.g. qml_de.ts, qml_en.ts)
4. Create pull request with exported translations
