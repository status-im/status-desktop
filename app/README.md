## Setup dependencies

Note: if not stated otherwise the commands should be run from the root of the source tree

### 1. conancenter

Execute `conan remote list`. It should return this line among the results:

```bash
conancenter: https://center.conan.io [Verify SSL: True]
```

If it doesn't, consider upgrading conan with `pip install conan --upgrade` and then executing. `conan remote add -i 0 conancenter https://center.conan.io`. See [conan's documentation](https://docs.conan.io/en/latest/uploading_packages/remotes.html#conancenter) for more info.

### 2. conan libstdc++11

This applies to linux: the default conan profile does not work, since GCC uses the new C++ ABI since version 5.1 and conan, for compatibility purposes uses the old C++ ABI.
Execute this to update the profile:

```bash
conan profile update settings.compiler.libcxx=libstdc++11 default
```

### 2. Install dependencies

Install latest Qt release 6.3.X

Platform specific conan profile

- Macos:
  - Apple silicon: `conan install . --profile=vendor/conan-configs/apple-arm64.ini -s build_type=Release --build=missing -if=build/conan -of=build`
  - Intel: `conan install . --profile=vendor/conan-configs/apple-x86_64.ini -s build_type=Release --build=missing -if=build/conan -of=build`
- Windows: TODO
- Linux: `conan install . --profile=./vendor/conan-configs/linux.ini -s build_type=Release --build=missing -if=build/conan -of=build`

## Buid, test & run

Update `CMake` to the [Latest Release](https://cmake.org/download/) or use the Qt's "$QTBASE/Tools/CMake/..."

### Build with cmake

```bash
# linux
cmake -B build -S . -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH="$HOME/Qt/6.3.2/gcc_64" -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=build/conan/conan_toolchain.cmake

# MacOS: cmake -B build -S . -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH="$HOME/Qt/6.3.2/macos" -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=build/conan/conan_toolchain.cmake

# Windows: cmake -B build -S . -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH="$HOME/Qt/6.3.2/mingw_64" -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=build/conan/conan_toolchain.cmake

cmake --build build
```

### Run tests

```bash
ctest --test-dir ./build
```

### Build with QtCreator

Go to QtCreator's preferences navigate to Environment -> System -> Environment -> Change add GOBIN to the PATH

### MacOS instructions

If go is installed with `brew` use the following configuration otherwise adapt it to your environment. Also this will allow access to conan if installed by brew

Use this in the Environment section of the QtCreator's preferences:

```ini
GOBIN=${GOPATH}/bin
GOPATH=${HOME}/go
PATH=${PATH}:${GOBIN}:/opt/homebrew/bin:/opt/homebrew/sbin
```
