# Building Storybook

For regular usage of **Storybook** it's enough to open `status-desktop/storybook/CMakeLists.txt` in QtCreator. Please **`do not use StoryBook.pro`** which is intended for WebAssembly builds. Please make sure that selected run target is `Storybook`.

Storybook may run in two modes (configurable by `-m`/`--mode` command line argument):
- **local** - in this mode local filesystem is observed directly and when change detected the page is unloaded, qml cache is cleaned and page is loaded again
- **remote** - in this mode the both change detection and qml files access is done via http server. It allows exposing local source code to remote devices

On desktop both modes work basically in the same way from the user perspective.

In order to run Storybook it's necessary to use remote mode:
- connect device
- start Storybook locally in remote mode
- set up reverse proxy (`adb reverse tcp:8080 tcp:8080`)
- run the Storybook on the device

For convenience the setup of reverse proxy can be easily added to the config
in QtCreator as a deployment step (`Custom Process Step`).


# Building Storybook with Webassembly and Qt 5.14

> [!WARNING]
> Both support for Webassembly and the instruction below are not maintained and
> won't work out of the box. Please use the standard build/deploy method.

## Configuring the environment
### Install Emscripten v1.38.27
	

    # Get the emsdk repo
    git clone https://github.com/emscripten-core/emsdk.git
    
    #go to emsdk folder
    cd emsdk
    
    #install Emscripten v1.38.27
    ./emsdk install emscripten-1.38.27
    
    #activate emscripten-1.38.27
    ./emsdk activate emscripten-1.38.27
    
    #install Fastcomp backend
    ./emsdk install fastcomp-clang-tag-e1.38.27-64bit
    
    #activate Fastcomp backend
    ./emsdk activate fastcomp-clang-tag-e1.38.27-64bit
    
    #add emsdk tools to env variables
    #this can be done by following instructions received from previous activate command
    #there are two options:
    
    #1. Configure the env variables for the current shell only:
    source emsdk_env.sh
    
    #2. Configure the env variables using the shell startup script:
    echo 'source "[path to emsdk folder]/emsdk_env.sh"' >> $HOME/.zprofile
    
    #WARNING: this will configure the environment to use the emsdk compiler
    #Ex:"which clang" command will now point to the emscripten clang instead of the system clang
    #to disable the env configuration comment the source command added earlier in ~/.zprofile
    
    #check environment
    #python needs to be installed. The emsdk scripts state that it should work with pyton 2 and 3
    #make sure python command can be resolved
    which python
    em++ --version
    emcc --version
    #clang should point to fastcomp-clang-tag-e1.38.27-64bit
    which clang
    which clang++

### Configure QtCreator (optional)
Newer versions of QtCreator won't support Qt5.14 with Webassembly. Latest version found to support Qt5.14 with WebAssembly is 4.14.2
Download: https://download.qt.io/archive/qtcreator/4.14/

Adding the Emscripten compilers (emcc and em++)
Details here: https://doc.qt.io/qtcreator/creator-tool-chains.html

Adding Qt version 5.14:
https://doc.qt.io/qtcreator/creator-project-qmake.html

Adding Qt5.14 for Webassembly kit:
https://doc.qt.io/qtcreator/creator-targets.html

Open StoryBook.pro in Qt Creator and configure it using the new kit.

Qt creator might not set the env paths correctly. In this case manually set build environment variables (Projects -> 5.14.2 kit -> Build -> Build Environment -> Batch edit). Ex:

    EMSCRIPTEN=~/Repos/emsdk/emscripten/1.38.27
    EMSDK=~/Repos/emsdk
    EMSDK_NODE=~/Repos/emsdk/node/14.18.2_64bit/bin/node
    EMSDK_PYTHON=~/Repos/emsdk/python/3.9.2_64bit/bin/python3
    EM_CONFIG=~/Repos/emsdk/.emscripten
    LLVM_ROOT=~/Repos/emsdk/fastcomp-clang/tag-e1.38.27/build_tag-e1.38.27_64/bin
    PATH=[check echo $PATH]

### Running qmake (without qt Creator)

    #create build folder
    mkdir buildStoryBook
    
    #go to folder
    cd buildStoryBook
    
    #run qmake (add CONFIG+=debug CONFIG+=qml_debug to qmake command for debug build)
    ~/Qt/5.14.2/wasm_32/bin/qmake [path to StoryBook.pro] -spec wasm-emscripten && /usr/bin/make qmake_all
    
    #build (add -j[nb of cores] for parallel execution)
    make
    
    #run
    emrun StoryBook.html
