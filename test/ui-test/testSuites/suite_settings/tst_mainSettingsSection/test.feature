    ** when user signs up with username "tester123" and password "TesTEr16843/!@00"
    ** and the user lands on the signed in app

    Background: Open settings section

	# TODO: It must be reformulated or extracted to a different feature file bc preconditions of this feature file also include closing the backup seed phrase indicator at first instance
	# so the validation is not providing relevant information
	# TODO: It is also unstable. Needs to be checked.
