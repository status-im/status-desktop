Feature: Status Desktop Chat Basic Flows

	As a user I want to join the public chat room "test" and do basic interactions.

    The following scenarios cover basic chat flows on "test" public channel.

    The feature start sequence is the following (setup on its own `bdd_hooks`):
    ** given A first time user lands on the status desktop and generates new key
    ** when user signs up with username "tester123" and password "TesTEr16843/!@00"
    ** and the user lands on the signed in app
    ** and user joins chat room "test"

	[Cleanup] Also each scenario starts with:
	** when the user opens the chat section
	# TODO: Add scenario end -> clear chat input.

    Scenario Outline: The user can chat in a public room
	     When the user sends a chat message "<message>"
		 Then the last chat message contains "<message>"
		 Examples:
		 | message  			 |
		 | Hello    			 |
		 | How are you    		 |
		 | I am from status   	 |
		 | tell me how you do?   |
